rem  Push the server code to the VPS and restart it there.
rem
rem  Run from this folder (the Dropbox copy). It copies server/, astrocontrol/
rem  and requirements.txt to the VPS over scp, then runs the installer there,
rem  which rebuilds the virtual environment and restarts the service. Your
rem  ssh key does the signing in; no password is typed here.
rem
rem  One file rather than three pasted lines, because a long ssh line pasted
rem  into PowerShell wraps, and the hostname ends up as a command of its own.
