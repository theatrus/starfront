"""What a collaboration is, in one place that both sides import.

The program and the server have to agree exactly on what a task is, what a
contribution is, and whether a night's data is acceptable.  Two implementations
of that would drift, and the first symptom of drift is a ledger that quietly
reports hours nobody can use — so there is one implementation and both import
it.

Deliberately dependency-free: standard library only, no numpy, no devices, no
FastAPI.  The server should be able to import this without dragging in a
telescope control program, and this module should be able to run anywhere.

**The unit of work is an area of sky, not a panel.**  Panels are an artifact of
one particular camera on one particular telescope; a project several rigs
contribute to cannot be defined in them.  So a project is a rectangle, a task is
a smaller rectangle inside it, and each rig works out its own panels to cover
what it was given.  Depth is integration time *at a point on the sky*, which is
the only definition that means the same thing to a 300 mm refractor and a
2000 mm reflector.

    """The one filter a rig shoots tonight on a mosaic.

    One filter a night per telescope: every panel it visits gets a stack in
    that filter, the wheel never turns between panels, and a night's frames
    all calibrate with one set of flats. Which filter is the collaboration's
    choice, not the rig's, and it is made in two steps.

    **The Moon first.** A bright Moon up for most of the dark hours makes it a
    night for Ha or SII, which shoot through moonlight; a dark night is spent
    on what cannot be shot any other time - luminance, the colour filters,
    OIII - and the narrowband is kept for the moonlit nights to come. Only
    filters still wanting work are considered, and when nothing of the
    preferred kind is left the other kind is used rather than nothing.

    **Then the least progress.** Among those, the filter with the most work
    still outstanding across the field once what the other telescopes are
    already putting in tonight is taken off it. Three rigs on a project
    wanting equal Ha, OIII and SII under no Moon are sent OIII, then Ha, then
    SII; when OIII is done nobody is sent to polish it while Ha is thin.

    `spoken` is the seconds already committed tonight per filter by the rigs
    dealt before this one. `moon` is the asking rig's own sky tonight, as it
    reported it; without it the Moon is not considered. Ties go to the
    project's own filter order.
