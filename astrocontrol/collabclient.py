"""Picking imaging tasks up from the collaboration server.

The observatory's half of the protocol: say hello, ask what to shoot, and hand
back what was captured.  Three calls.

**Nothing here can stop a night.**  The server is a source of suggestions, not
a dependency: if it is unreachable, the last task it gave is still on the plan
and the run carries on exactly as it would have.  A rig at a dark site behind a
domestic connection has to work when the connection does not, and a collab that
could take a night away by going down would be worse than no collab.

**Nothing here starts imaging on its own either.**  A task arrives *offered*
and stays that way until somebody accepts it.  An assignment that silently
rewrote what a mount did tonight would be the software going rogue, however
well meant — so this fetches, reports and waits to be told.
