"""Running the plan: the thing that actually moves the telescope all night.

The sequencer walks the plan in order and, for each target, points the rig,
focuses, and takes the frames that were asked for.  Mosaics are walked tile by
tile in the order the scheduler worked out, so neighbouring tiles are shot next
to each other in time.

**More than one telescope.**  One rig is the master: it carries the mount and
the guider, so it decides where everything points and when everything dithers.
Every other rig is bolted to the same mount and cannot point itself, so the
sequencer runs the night in *slots*.  A slot starts an exposure on every
telescope at once, waits for all of them, and only then dithers — so a slave is
never mid-frame while the master nudges the mount, which is the whole reason to
do it this way rather than letting each scope run its own loop.  Autofocus works
the same way: when any telescope is due a run, every telescope with a focuser
sweeps at the same time, because the mount is not usable for imaging by anyone
while one of them is defocused.

Each telescope keeps its own allocation, so the master can be taking five-minute
luminance while the faster scope alongside it takes ten-minute Ha of the same
field.  Both write the same OBJECT — including the panel, for a mosaic — so the
frames stack together whichever telescope they came off.

Two events interrupt imaging and are handled rather than avoided:

  * **the meridian** - a German equatorial mount cannot track through it.
    Imaging stops before the target gets there, the mount is sent back to the
    same coordinates (which makes the driver flip), the new pointing is plate
    solved and synced, and imaging resumes.
  * **focus drift** - temperature moves, filters are not parfocal, and hours
    pass.  A focus run is triggered on whichever of those comes first.

Everything checks for an abort between steps.  Stopping is always allowed and
always leaves the mount tracking where it is rather than parking it, because a
surprise slew in the dark is worse than a stopped sequence.
