"""Plate solving with ASTAP.

ASTAP is a command line solver: it is handed a FITS file plus a hint about
where the telescope thinks it is pointing, and writes the answer to a small
`.ini` file beside its output path.  Everything here is that conversation, plus
the two things a solved position is actually good for at the eyepiece:

  * **sync**   - tell the mount where it really is, once.
  * **centre** - solve, sync, slew back to the target and solve again, until the
    target is under the crosshair.  This is what makes "go to M51" land M51 in
    the middle of the frame rather than somewhere in the general area.

Solves run on their own thread; the UI polls `status()` through the status
socket, exactly like a capture.
