"""Everything that could quietly go wrong, said out loud.

A rig fails in two ways. Loudly - an exception, a device that refuses - which
the sequencer already reports. And quietly: the cooler that never reached
its setpoint, the mount whose site is a hundred miles from the observatory,
the cover that stayed shut, the disk with two frames' worth of room, the
frames that have had no stars in them since the cloud came over. Nothing
throws, the night runs to the end, and the morning finds it was wasted.

This is the board those go on. A watchdog looks at the whole rig every few
seconds and keeps a live list: each thing wrong is one entry with a level, a
plain sentence saying what, and where possible a sentence saying what to do.
Entries clear themselves when the condition goes away, so the list is always
what is wrong *now*. The strip at the top of the window shows it; anything
critical also goes out as a notification, once, so somebody not in the room
hears about it while there is still night left.

The checks are plain functions over a `Context` - the live objects the
program holds - and each is wrapped so that a check that breaks can never
take the watchdog with it.
