# The collaboration server

Where imaging tasks come from.

An observatory runs Starfront and asks this, every few minutes, "what should
I shoot?". It answers with a task — a rectangle of sky, some filters, and how
deep to go — and takes back what was actually captured, judging it against the
rules the coordinator set.

## Running it

```
python server/run.py
```

Or double-click `Start the collab server.cmd`. That is the whole thing: it
makes up a coordinator token on the first run, keeps it beside the database and
prints it, so there is nothing to configure and nothing to remember. Paste it
into Starfront under **Collab → Running a collaboration**.

It listens on this machine only. A telescope on another PC needs
`--host 0.0.0.0`; nothing else does, and a service that quietly listened to the
network on somebody's behalf would be a poor default.

The token lives in `admin-token.txt` beside the database, **not** in the program
folder — that one is synchronised to Dropbox, and a credential that can rewrite
every project has no business in a synchronised folder or in a launcher script
somebody might share.

| | |
|---|---|
| `ASTROCOLLAB_DATA` | where the database and the token live (default: the `collab` folder beside your settings) |
| `ASTROCOLLAB_ADMIN_TOKEN` | overrides the token file, for a service definition or a password manager |
| `--show-token` | print the token and exit |

## Putting it on a VPS, with Discord sign-in

A server other people use wants to be always on and reachable over HTTPS —
Discord will only send people back to an `https://` address. A small Linux
VPS (Ubuntu or Debian, the cheapest tier) and a hostname pointed at it is all
it takes; `server/deploy/install.sh` does the rest.

1. **Point a hostname at the VPS.** An `A` record, e.g. `collab.example.org`
   → the VPS's IP. Caddy fetches the certificate itself once that resolves.

2. **Create the Discord application** at
   <https://discord.com/developers/applications> → *New Application* →
   *OAuth2*. Note the **Client ID**, generate a **Client Secret**, and add
   the redirect `https://collab.example.org/auth/discord/callback`. No bot is
   needed and no scopes beyond `identify` and `guilds.members.read`, which
   the server asks for by itself. Get your **server (guild) id** from Server
   Settings → Widget, and, if only some people should be able to *start*
   collaborations, the **role id** of that role.

3. **Install.** On the VPS, as a user with sudo, with this repository copied
   or cloned there:

   ```bash
   sudo bash server/deploy/install.sh collab.example.org
   ```

   It installs Python and Caddy, copies the server to `/opt/astrocollab`,
   makes a venv, creates the `astrocollab` system user with its data in
   `/var/lib/astrocollab`, installs and starts the systemd service on
   loopback, and puts Caddy in front of it on your hostname. It prints the
   owner token at the end. Run it again after pulling a newer version; it
   leaves the data alone.

4. **Fill in Discord.** Edit `/var/lib/astrocollab/discord.env` — the values
   from step 2, plus your own Discord user id under
   `ASTROCOLLAB_DISCORD_OWNERS` so that you are an owner when you sign in —
   and `sudo systemctl restart astrocollab`. The startup line says
   `discord   sign-in on, guild …` when it has taken.

5. **In Starfront**, everybody presses *Join with Discord*. The server's
   address is built into the program (`collab.DEFAULT_SERVER`); a build for a
   different server changes that one line. The owner token the script
   printed is only needed for scripts and emergencies — an owner signs in
   like everybody else.

| | |
|---|---|
| `journalctl -u astrocollab -f` | the server's log |
| `sudo systemctl restart astrocollab` | after changing `discord.env` |
| `/var/lib/astrocollab/collab.sqlite` | the database — back it up by copying it |
| `curl https://collab.example.org/api/v1/health` | `"discord": true` when sign-in is on |

**How sign-in works.** The device-code flow, because Starfront is a desktop
program: it asks the server for a login code (`POST /api/v1/auth/login`) and
opens the browser on `/auth/discord/start?code=…`; the server sends the
browser to Discord; Discord sends it back to `/auth/discord/callback`; the
server checks the person is in the guild, notes their roles, mints a user
token and ties it to the code; Starfront, polling `/api/v1/auth/poll`, is
handed the token once. The client secret never leaves the server. One token
per person: signing in on a second machine signs the first out.

**Who may do what.** A *telescope* (agent token) fetches work and reports
frames — nothing else, ever. A *member* (user token) enrols their own
telescopes, and, holding the role if one is required, starts collaborations
and changes or closes the ones they started. The *owner* (admin token) may do
anything. Membership of the Discord server is the account; somebody who leaves
it cannot sign in again, and the server never lets a stranger in.

## The shape of it

**Pull, not push.** The agent asks; the server never reaches into an
observatory. That is not only simpler — no delivery guarantees, no queue,
nothing to get stuck — it is the only arrangement where a rig behind a domestic
router at a dark site works at all, and where the server going down means "no
new tasks" rather than "the night stops".

**Two kinds of caller, and they cannot do each other's jobs.** An *agent* is a
telescope, holding a token that lives in a settings file on an observatory PC.
A *person* is somebody signed in with Discord, or the server's owner on the
admin token. A telescope's credential must never be able to rewrite a project,
and a person's login must never be able to drive a mount, so they are separate
dependencies rather than roles on one credential.

**The unit of work is an area of sky, not a panel.** Panels are an artifact of
one particular camera on one particular telescope; a project several rigs
contribute to cannot be defined in them. A mosaic project is a rectangle; a rig
that joins is handed the whole of it tiled with its own camera, and each night
a list of which of those cells to shoot and how many frames to put on each. A
`single` project is one object: every rig is handed one cell, its own frame
centred on it, and nobody tiles the framer's field however narrow their camera.

**Depth is integration time at a point on the sky** — the only definition that
means the same thing to a 300 mm refractor and a 2000 mm reflector.

**The night is dealt from the depth map.** Every contribution carries the
footprint of the panel it was shot over, so each rig's cells can be credited
with what has really landed on them — by everybody, per filter, and by that rig
alone. `collab.assign` picks a rig's panels for a night in that order of pull:
not where somebody else is tonight; where this rig has been least; where the
field is thinnest. The night is cut into as many visits as it holds, never
shorter than the project's `minFramesPerVisit` in any filter, because a rig has
to stack its own frames. Finished cells are skipped. A list holds for the
night the rig says it is in (`GET /api/v1/agent/task?night=...`) and is remade
the first time it asks in the next, so the whole thing moves on by default.

**One row per agent, task, night, filter and panel.** A panel reported again
with more frames replaces the row at the larger figure; a coordinator's
overruling of a verdict stands through that.

## The agent's protocol — three calls

| | |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/v1/agent/hello` | here is what I am and what I can do |
| `GET /api/v1/agent/task` | what should I shoot? |
| `POST /api/v1/agent/report` | here is what I captured |

A task arrives **offered** and stays that way until somebody accepts it. An
assignment that silently rewrote what a mount did tonight would be the software
going rogue, however well meant.

## Types

Every request and response has a type in `server/schemas.py`: the rig profile,
regions and cells, requirements, tasks, contributions, verdicts and presence.
They write down the dictionaries the protocol already uses, so nothing about
the wire changed:

- Field names are the ones already sent.
- Fields a model does not know are kept, so a newer program is never refused.
- Numbers are read as `astrocontrol/collab.py` reads them: a blank or unreadable
  value is unknown, not an error.
- Responses carry exactly the keys they did before.

FastAPI publishes the result at `/openapi.json` and `/docs`. The same document
is committed as `server/openapi.json`; after changing a type, run
`python tools/export_collab_api.py` and commit what changed.
`python tools/check_collab_types.py` checks the lenient reading and that the
committed document is current.

## Judging

`astrocontrol/collab.py` holds the rules, and **both sides import it** — the
server to judge what arrives, the program to warn an operator before they waste
a night. Two implementations would drift, and the first symptom of drift is a
ledger reporting hours nobody can use.

Everything is in units that mean the same thing on every rig. **Star size is in
arcseconds, never pixels**: 2.5 px is superb at 0.5″/px and unusable at 3″/px,
and a ledger that compared them directly would be worse than no ledger.

Verdicts are **advisory**. A coordinator can overrule one, and should be able
to: seeing varies, and a night the numbers reject may be the only data anybody
has on that patch of sky.

## What is deliberately not here yet

- **A drawn depth map.** The depth map exists at the resolution of each rig's
  cells and drives the dealing; nothing rasterises it for a picture yet.

## Driving it

There is no web interface here, and there is not going to be one. The
coordinator's screen is the **Collab** tab in Starfront, which holds both
credentials and makes these calls on the operator's behalf — so a token that can
rewrite every project on the server is never in a page, in devtools, or in any
extension that asks for it.

`python tools/check_server.py` exercises the whole protocol over real HTTP
against a real server on a real port. `python tools/check_coordinator.py`
covers the tiling arithmetic and tries each credential against the other's
endpoints.
