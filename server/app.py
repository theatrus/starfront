"""The collaboration server: where imaging tasks come from.

An observatory runs Starfront and asks this, periodically, "what should I
shoot?".  It answers with a task — a rectangle of sky, some filters, and how
deep to go — and takes back what was actually captured.

**Pull, not push.**  The agent asks; the server never reaches into an
observatory.  That is not only simpler — no delivery guarantees, no queue, no
retries, nothing to get stuck — it is also the only arrangement where a rig
behind a domestic router at a dark site works at all, and where the server
going down means "no new tasks" rather than "the night stops".

**Two kinds of caller.**  An *agent* is a telescope, authenticated with a token
that belongs to the machine.  A *person* is a coordinator, and will eventually
be authenticated through Discord — for now that is a stub provider, so this can
be built and tested before a Discord application exists.  The split matters:
a telescope's credential should never be able to administer a project, and a
person's login should never be able to drive a mount.
