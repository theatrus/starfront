"""Centring on a mount that will not take a sync.

    python tools/check_centring.py

Found on a real night: TheSky's ASCOM driver throws at SyncToCoordinates.
The first fallback nudged the slew by the measured error - but from the
last nudged aim rather than from the target, so each attempt added the
error again and the mount walked steadily away from the field, a tenth of
a degree a time, until the attempts ran out. The nudge has to be worked
out from the target every time.

No test framework, for the same reason as the other checks here.
