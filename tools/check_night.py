"""Exercise how a night starts and how it ends.

    python tools/check_night.py

These are the parts nobody watches.  A sequence starts while the operator is
still in the room, so a slow start is merely annoying; it *ends* at four in the
morning, and everything that goes wrong there is found at breakfast.  The faults
this covers were all found that way:

  * Stop appeared to hang, because the warm-down ran on the sequencer thread and
    held the run open for ten minutes of sleeping.
  * Guiding was still running at dawn, because guiding was only ever stopped as
    a side effect of parking — and parking is off by default.
  * The mount was never parked, for the same reason plus the warm-down in front
    of it.
  * The night stood still waiting for the sensor to reach -10 C before it would
    slew, instead of cooling while it homed, slewed, centred and focused.
  * The mount was never homed, so a power cycle meant every slew of the night
    was wrong by the same amount.

No test framework, for the same reason as the other checks here.
