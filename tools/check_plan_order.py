"""Exercise how the sequencer walks a plan, against stub devices.

    python tools/check_plan_order.py

The plan is walked in order, each target finished before the next — so what
needs checking is not the walking but the *skipping*: the filter order, the
altitude floor, the Moon limit, the switch and the integration goal each decide
whether frames are taken at all, and each of them failing open costs a night
while each failing closed costs a target.

No test framework, for the same reason as `check_recovery.py`: this runs from a
cold checkout with nothing installed but what Starfront already needs.
