"""Exercise the sequencer's recovery paths against stub devices.

    python tools/check_recovery.py

Recovery is the one part of the program that only ever runs when nobody is
watching it — the guide star goes at three in the morning or it does not go at
all — so it is the part least likely to be noticed when it breaks and the part
worst to discover broken in the morning.  Stub devices stand in for the mount,
the guider, the focuser and the camera, each told to fail in a particular way,
and each recovery is checked for doing the right thing *and* for stopping.

No test framework: the project has no dependency on one, and this runs from a
cold checkout with nothing installed but what Starfront already needs.
